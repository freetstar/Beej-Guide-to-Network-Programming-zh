<h2 class="sect1title">3. <a name="ipstructsdata">IP Addresses, <nobr><b><tt class="titletype">struct</tt></b></nobr>s, and Data Munging</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>Here's the part of the game where we get to talk code for a
change.</p>

<p>But first, let's discuss more non-code!  Yay!  First I want to talk
about <a name="indexId434909-79"></a>IP addresses and ports for just a tad so we have
that sorted out.  Then we'll talk about how the sockets API stores and
manipulates IP addresses and other data.</p>



<h3 class="sect2title">3.1. <a name="ipaddrs1">IP Addresses, versions 4 and 6</a></h3>


<p>In the good old days back when Ben Kenobi was still called Obi Wan
Kenobi, there was a wonderful network routing system called The Internet
Protocol Version 4, also called <a name="indexId434909-80"></a>IPv4.  It had addresses
made up of four bytes (A.K.A. four "octets"), and was commonly written
in "dots and numbers" form, like so: <tt class="tt">192.0.2.111</tt>.</p>

<p>You've probably seen it around.</p>

<p>In fact, as of this writing, virtually every site on the Internet
uses IPv4.</p>

<p>Everyone, including Obi Wan, was happy.  Things were great, until
some naysayer by the name of Vint Cerf warned everyone that we were
about to run out of IPv4 addresses!</p>

<p>(Besides warning everyone of the Coming IPv4 Apocalypse Of Doom And
Gloom, <a name="indexId434909-81"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinton_Cerf" target="_blank">Vint Cerf</a> is
also well-known for being The Father Of The Internet.  So I really am in
no position to second-guess his judgment.)</p>

<p>Run out of addresses?  How could this be?  I mean, there are like
billions of IP addresses in a 32-bit IPv4 address.  Do we really have
billions of computers out there?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Also, in the beginning, when there were only a few computers and
everyone thought a billion was an impossibly large number, some big
organizations were generously allocated millions of IP addresses for
their own use.  (Such as Xerox, MIT, Ford, HP, IBM, GE, AT&amp;T, and
some little company called Apple, to name a few.)</p>

<p>In fact, if it weren't for several stopgap measures, we would have
run out a long time ago.</p>

<p>But now we're living in an era where we're talking about every human
having an IP address, every computer, every calculator, every phone,
every parking meter, and (why not) every puppy dog, as well.</p>

<p>And so, <a name="indexId434909-82"></a>IPv6 was born.  Since Vint Cerf is probably
immortal (even if his physical form should pass on, heaven forbid, he is
probably already existing as some kind of hyper-intelligent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" target="_blank">ELIZA</a> program out in the depths of the
Internet2), no one wants to have to hear him say again "I told you so"
if we don't have enough addresses in the next version of the Internet
Protocol.</p>

<p>What does this suggest to you?</p>

<p>That we need a <i>lot</i> more addresses.  That we need not just
twice as many addresses, not a billion times as many, not a thousand
trillion times as many, but <i>79 MILLION BILLION TRILLION times as
many possible addresses!</i>  That'll show 'em!</p>

<p>You're saying, "Beej, is that true?  I have every reason to
disbelieve large numbers."  Well, the difference between 32 bits and 128
bits might not sound like a lot; it's only 96 more bits, right?  But
remember, we're talking powers here: 32 bits represents some 4 billion
numbers (2<sup><small>32</small></sup>), while 128 bits represents about 340
trillion trillion trillion numbers (for real, 2<sup><small>128</small></sup>).
That's like a million IPv4 Internets for <i>every single star in the
Universe</i>.</p>

<p>Forget this dots-and-numbers look of IPv4, too; now we've got a
hexadecimal representation, with each two-byte chunk separated by a
colon, like this: <tt class="tt">2001:0db8:c9d2:aee5:73e3:934a:a5ae:9551</tt>.</p>

<p>That's not all!  Lots of times, you'll have an IP address with lots
of zeros in it, and you can compress them between two colons.  And you
can leave off leading zeros for each byte pair.  For instance, each of
these pairs of addresses are equivalent:</p>

<pre class="screen">2001:0db8:c9d2:0012:0000:0000:0000:0051
2001:db8:c9d2:12::51

2001:0db8:ab00:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000
2001:db8:ab00::

0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
::1
</pre>


<p>The address <tt class="tt">::1</tt> is the <i>loopback address</i>.  It
always means "this machine I'm running on now".  In IPv4, the loopback
address is 127.0.0.1.</p>

<p>Finally, there's an IPv4-compatibility mode for IPv6 addresses that
you might come across.  If you want, for example, to represent the IPv4
address 192.0.2.33 as an IPv6 address, you use the following notation:
"<tt class="tt">::ffff:192.0.2.33</tt>".</p>

<p>We're talking serious fun.</p>

<p>In fact, it's such serious fun, that the Creators of IPv6 have quite
cavalierly lopped off trillions and trillions of addresses for reserved
use, but we have so many, frankly, who's even counting anymore?  There
are plenty left over for every man, woman, child, puppy, and parking
meter on every planet in the galaxy.  And believe me, every planet in
the galaxy has parking meters.  You know it's true.</p>



<h4 class="sect3title">3.1.1. <a name="netslash">Subnets</a></h4>


<p>For organizational reasons, it's sometimes convenient to declare that
"this first part of this IP address up through this bit is the
<i>network portion</i> of the IP address, and the remainder is the
<i>host portion</i>.</p>

<p>For instance, with IPv4, you might have <tt class="tt">192.0.2.12</tt>, and we could say
that the first three bytes are the network and the last byte was the
host.  Or, put another way, we're talking about host <tt class="tt">12</tt> on
network <tt class="tt">192.0.2.0</tt> (see how we zero out the byte that was the
host.)</p>

<p>And now for more outdated information!  Ready?  In the Ancient Times,
there were "classes" of subnets, where the first one, two, or three
bytes of the address was the network part.  If you were lucky enough to
have one byte for the network and three for the host, you could have
24 bits-worth of hosts on your network (24 million or so).  That was a
"Class A" network.  On the opposite end was a "Class C", with three
bytes of network, and one byte of host (256 hosts, minus a couple that
were reserved.)</p>

<p>So as you can see, there were just a few Class As, a huge pile of
Class Cs, and some Class Bs in the middle.</p>

<p>The network portion of the IP address is described by something
called the <i>netmask</i>, which you bitwise-AND with the IP address
to get the network number out of it.  The netmask usually looks
something like <tt class="tt">255.255.255.0</tt>.  (E.g. with that netmask, if your
IP is <tt class="tt">192.0.2.12</tt>, then your network is <tt class="tt">192.0.2.12</tt> AND
<tt class="tt">255.255.255.0</tt> which gives <tt class="tt">192.0.2.0</tt>.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that this wasn't fine-grained enough for
the eventual needs of the Internet; we were running out of Class C
networks quite quickly, and we were most definitely out of Class As, so
don't even bother to ask.  To remedy this, The Powers That Be allowed
for the netmask to be an arbitrary number of bits, not just 8, 16, or
24.  So you might have a netmask of, say <tt class="tt">255.255.255.252</tt>, which
is 30 bits of network, and 2 bits of host allowing for four hosts on the
network.  (Note that the netmask is <i>ALWAYS</i> a bunch of 1-bits
followed by a bunch of 0-bits.)</p>

<p>But it's a bit unwieldy to use a big string of numbers like
<tt class="tt">255.192.0.0</tt> as a netmask.  First of all, people don't have an
intuitive idea of how many bits that is, and secondly, it's really not
compact.  So the New Style came along, and it's much nicer.  You just
put a slash after the IP address, and then follow that by the number of
network bits in decimal.  Like this: <tt class="tt">192.0.2.12/30</tt>.</p>

<p>Or, for IPv6, something like this: <tt class="tt">2001:db8::/32</tt> or
<tt class="tt">2001:db8:5413:4028::9db9/64</tt>.</p>





<h4 class="sect3title">3.1.2. <a name="portnums">Port Numbers</a></h4>


<p>If you'll kindly remember, I presented you earlier with the <a href="theory.html#lowlevel">Layered Network Model</a> which had the Internet
Layer (IP) split off from the Host-to-Host Transport Layer (TCP and
UDP).  Get up to speed on that before the next paragraph.</p>

<p>Turns out that besides an IP address (used by the IP layer), there
is another address that is used by TCP (stream sockets) and,
coincidentally, by UDP (datagram sockets).  It is the <i>port
number</i>.  It's a 16-bit number that's like the local address for
the connection.</p>

<p>Think of the IP address as the street address of a hotel, and the
port number as the room number.  That's a decent analogy; maybe later
I'll come up with one involving the automobile industry.</p>

<p>Say you want to have a computer that handles incoming mail AND web
services—how do you differentiate between the two on a computer
with a single IP address?</p>

<p>Well, different services on the Internet have different well-known
port numbers.  You can see them all in <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers" target="_blank">the Big
IANA Port List</a> or, if you're on a Unix box, in your
<i><tt class="var">/etc/services</tt></i> file.  HTTP (the web) is port 80, telnet is
port 23, SMTP is port 25, the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)" target="_blank">DOOM</a>
used port 666, etc. and so on.  Ports under 1024 are often considered
special, and usually require special OS privileges to use.</p>

<p>And that's about it!</p>

 

 



<h3 class="sect2title">3.2. <a name="byteorder">Byte Order</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-83"></a>By Order of the Realm!  There shall be two
byte orderings, hereafter to be known as Lame and Magnificent!</p>

<p>I joke, but one really is better than the other.  <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p>There really is no easy way to say this, so I'll just blurt it out:
your computer might have been storing bytes in reverse order behind your
back.  I know!  No one wanted to have to tell you.</p>

<p>The thing is, everyone in the Internet world has generally agreed
that if you want to represent the two-byte hex number, say
<tt class="tt">b34f</tt>, you'll store it in two sequential bytes <tt class="tt">b3</tt>
followed by <tt class="tt">4f</tt>.  Makes sense, and, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilford_Brimley" target="_blank">Wilford Brimley</a> would tell you, it's the Right
Thing To Do.  This number, stored with the big end first, is called
<i>Big-Endian</i>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a few computers scattered here and there throughout
the world, namely anything with an Intel or Intel-compatible processor,
store the bytes reversed, so <tt class="tt">b34f</tt> would be stored in memory as
the sequential bytes <tt class="tt">4f</tt> followed by <tt class="tt">b3</tt>.  This storage
method is called <i>Little-Endian</i>.</p>

<p>But wait, I'm not done with terminology yet!  The more-sane
<i>Big-Endian</i> is also called <i>Network Byte Order</i>
because that's the order us network types like.</p>

<p>Your computer stores numbers in <i>Host Byte Order</i>.  If it's
an Intel 80x86, Host Byte Order is Little-Endian.  If it's a Motorola
68k, Host Byte Order is Big-Endian.  If it's a PowerPC, Host Byte Order
is...  well, it depends!</p>

<p>A lot of times when you're building packets or filling out data
structures you'll need to make sure your two- and four-byte numbers are
in Network Byte Order.  But how can you do this if you don't know the
native Host Byte Order?</p>

<p>Good news!  You just get to assume the Host Byte Order isn't right,
and you always run the value through a function to set it to Network
Byte Order.  The function will do the magic conversion if it has to, and
this way your code is portable to machines of differing endianness.</p>

<p>All righty.  There are two types of numbers that you can convert:
<nobr><tt class="type">short</tt></nobr> (two bytes) and <nobr><tt class="type">long</tt></nobr> (four bytes).
These functions work for the <nobr><tt class="type">unsigned</tt></nobr> variations as well.
Say you want to convert a <nobr><tt class="type">short</tt></nobr> from Host Byte Order to
Network Byte Order.  Start with "h" for "host", follow it with "to",
then "n" for "network", and "s" for "short": h-to-n-s, or
<b><tt class="func">htons()</tt></b> (read: "Host to Network Short").</p>

<p>It's almost too easy...</p>

<p>You can use every combination of "n", "h", "s", and "l" you want,
not counting the really stupid ones.  For example, there is NOT a
<b><tt class="func">stolh()</tt></b> ("Short to Long Host") function—not at this
party, anyway.  But there are:</p>

<p>
<center><table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="joetable">

<tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="20%%"><p><a name="indexId434909-84"></a><b><tt class="func">htons()</tt></b></p></td>
<td valign="top" align="left" width="78%%"><p><b><tt class="func">h</tt></b>ost <b><tt class="func">to</tt></b> <b><tt class="func">n</tt></b>etwork <b><tt class="func">s</tt></b>hort</p></td>

<tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p><a name="indexId434909-85"></a><b><tt class="func">htonl()</tt></b></p></td>
<td valign="top" align="left"><p><b><tt class="func">h</tt></b>ost <b><tt class="func">to</tt></b> <b><tt class="func">n</tt></b>etwork <b><tt class="func">l</tt></b>ong</p></td>

<tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p><a name="indexId434909-86"></a><b><tt class="func">ntohs()</tt></b></p></td>
<td valign="top" align="left"><p><b><tt class="func">n</tt></b>etwork <b><tt class="func">to</tt></b> <b><tt class="func">h</tt></b>ost <b><tt class="func">s</tt></b>hort</p></td>

</tr>

</table></center>

</p>

<p>Basically, you'll want to convert the numbers to Network Byte Order
before they go out on the wire, and convert them to Host Byte Order as
they come in off the wire.</p>

<p>I don't know of a 64-bit variant, sorry.  And if you want to do
floating point, check out the section on <a href="advanced.html#serialization">Serialization</a>, far below.</p>

<p>Assume the numbers in this document are in Host Byte Order unless I
say otherwise.</p>

 



<h3 class="sect2title">3.3. <a name="structs"><nobr><b><tt class="titletype">struct</tt></b></nobr>s</a></h3>


<p>Well, we're finally here.  It's time to talk about programming.
In this section, I'll cover various data types used by the sockets
interface, since some of them are a real bear to figure out.</p>

<p>First the easy one: a <a name="indexId434909-88"></a>socket descriptor.
A socket descriptor is the following type:</p>

<pre class="code">int</pre>


<p>Just a regular <nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr>.</p>

<p>Things get weird from here, so just read through and bear with
me.</p>

<p>My First Struct<sup><small>TM</small></sup>—<a name="indexId434909-89"></a><nobr><tt class="type">struct
addrinfo</tt></nobr>.  This structure is a more recent invention, and is used
to prep the socket address structures for subsequent use.  It's also
used in host name lookups, and service name lookups.  That'll make more
sense later when we get to actual usage, but just know for now that it's
one of the first things you'll call when making a connection.</p>

<pre class="code">struct addrinfo {
    int              ai_flags;     // AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, etc.
    int              ai_family;    // AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNSPEC
    int              ai_socktype;  // SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM
    int              ai_protocol;  // use 0 for "any"
    size_t           ai_addrlen;   // size of ai_addr in bytes
    struct sockaddr *ai_addr;      // struct sockaddr_in or _in6
    char            *ai_canonname; // full canonical hostname

    struct addrinfo *ai_next;      // linked list, next node
};</pre>


<p>You'll load this struct up a bit, and then call <a name="indexId434909-90"></a><b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b>.  It'll return a pointer
to a new linked list of these structures filled out with all the goodies
you need.</p>

<p>You can force it to use IPv4 or IPv6 in the <i><tt class="var">ai_family</tt></i>
field, or leave it as <tt class="const">AF_UNSPEC</tt> to use whatever.  This is
cool because your code can be IP version-agnostic.</p>

<p>Note that this is a linked list: <i><tt class="var">ai_next</tt></i> points at the
next element—there could be several results for you to choose
from.  I'd use the first result that worked, but you might have
different business needs; I don't know everything, man!</p>

<p>You'll see that the <i><tt class="var">ai_addr</tt></i> field in the <nobr><tt class="type">struct
addrinfo</tt></nobr> is a pointer to a <a name="indexId434909-91"></a><nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr>.  This is where we start getting
into the nitty-gritty details of what's inside an IP address
structure.</p>

<p>You might not usually need to write to these structures; oftentimes,
a call to <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> to fill out your <nobr><tt class="type">struct
addrinfo</tt></nobr> for you is all you'll need.  You <i>will</i>,
however, have to peer inside these <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>s to get the
values out, so I'm presenting them here.</p>

<p>(Also, all the code written before <nobr><tt class="type">struct addrinfo</tt></nobr> was
invented packed all this stuff by hand, so you'll see a lot of IPv4 code
out in the wild that does exactly that.  You know, in old versions of
this guide and so on.)</p>

<p>Some <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>s are IPv4, some are IPv6, and some are both.
I'll make notes of which are what.</p>

<p>Anyway, the <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr> holds socket address
information for many types of sockets.</p>

<pre class="code">struct sockaddr {
    unsigned short    sa_family;    // address family, AF_xxx
    char              sa_data[14];  // 14 bytes of protocol address
}; 
</pre>


<p><i><tt class="var">sa_family</tt></i> can be a variety of things, but it'll be <a name="indexId434909-92"></a><tt class="const">AF_INET</tt> (IPv4) or <a name="indexId434909-93"></a><tt class="const">AF_INET6</tt> (IPv6) for everything we do in
this document.  <i><tt class="var">sa_data</tt></i> contains a destination address
and port number for the socket.  This is rather unwieldy since you don't
want to tediously pack the address in the <i><tt class="var">sa_data</tt></i> by
hand.</p>

<p>To deal with <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr>, programmers created a
parallel structure: <a name="indexId434909-94"></a><nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_in</tt></nobr> ("in" for "Internet") to be used with IPv4.</p>

<p>And <i>this is the important</i> bit: a pointer to a <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_in</tt></nobr> can be cast to a pointer to a <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr</tt></nobr> and vice-versa.  So even though <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>
wants a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr*</tt></nobr>, you can still use a <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_in</tt></nobr> and cast it at the last minute!</p>

<pre class="code">// (IPv4 only--see struct sockaddr_in6 for IPv6)

struct sockaddr_in {
    short int          sin_family;  // Address family, AF_INET
    unsigned short int sin_port;    // Port number
    struct in_addr     sin_addr;    // Internet address
    unsigned char      sin_zero[8]; // Same size as struct sockaddr
};
</pre>


<p>This structure makes it easy to reference elements of the socket
address.  Note that <i><tt class="var">sin_zero</tt></i> (which is included to pad
the structure to the length of a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr>) should be
set to all zeros with the function <b><tt class="func">memset()</tt></b>.  Also, notice
that <i><tt class="var">sin_family</tt></i> corresponds to <i><tt class="var">sa_family</tt></i>
in a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr> and should be set to
"<tt class="const">AF_INET</tt>".  Finally, the <i><tt class="var">sin_port</tt></i> must be
in <a name="indexId434909-95"></a><i>Network Byte Order</i> (by using <a name="indexId434909-96"></a><b><tt class="func">htons()</tt></b>!)</p>

<p>Let's dig deeper!  You see the <i><tt class="var">sin_addr</tt></i> field is a
<nobr><tt class="type">struct in_addr</tt></nobr>.  What is that thing?  Well, not to be
overly dramatic, but it's one of the scariest unions of all time:</p>

<pre class="code">// (IPv4 only--see struct in6_addr for IPv6)

// Internet address (a structure for historical reasons)
struct in_addr {
    uint32_t s_addr; // that's a 32-bit int (4 bytes)
};</pre>


<p>Whoa!  Well, it <i>used</i> to be a union, but now those days
seem to be gone.  Good riddance.  So if you have declared
<i><tt class="var">ina</tt></i> to be of type <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in</tt></nobr>, then
<i><tt class="var">ina.sin_addr.s_addr</tt></i> references the 4-byte IP address (in
Network Byte Order).  Note that even if your system still uses the
God-awful union for <nobr><tt class="type">struct in_addr</tt></nobr>, you can still reference
the 4-byte IP address in exactly the same way as I did above (this due
to <tt class="tt">#define</tt>s.)</p>

<p>What about <a name="indexId434909-97"></a>IPv6?  Similar <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>s exist
for it, as well:</p>

<pre class="code">// (IPv6 only--see struct sockaddr_in and struct in_addr for IPv4)

struct sockaddr_in6 {
    u_int16_t       sin6_family;   // address family, AF_INET6
    u_int16_t       sin6_port;     // port number, Network Byte Order
    u_int32_t       sin6_flowinfo; // IPv6 flow information
    struct in6_addr sin6_addr;     // IPv6 address
    u_int32_t       sin6_scope_id; // Scope ID
};

struct in6_addr {
    unsigned char   s6_addr[16];   // IPv6 address
};</pre>


<p>Note that IPv6 has an IPv6 address and a port number, just like IPv4
has an IPv4 address and a port number.</p>

<p>Also note that I'm not going to talk about the IPv6 flow information
or Scope ID fields for the moment... this is just a starter guide.
<tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p>Last but not least, here is another simple structure, <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr_storage</tt></nobr> that is designed
to be large enough to hold both IPv4 and IPv6 structures.  (See, for
some calls, sometimes you don't know in advance if it's going to fill
out your <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr</tt></nobr> with an IPv4 or IPv6 address.  So
you pass in this parallel structure, very similar to <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sockaddr</tt></nobr> except larger, and then cast it to the type you
need:</p>

<pre class="code">struct sockaddr_storage {
    sa_family_t  ss_family;     // address family

    // all this is padding, implementation specific, ignore it:
    char      __ss_pad1[_SS_PAD1SIZE];
    int64_t   __ss_align;
    char      __ss_pad2[_SS_PAD2SIZE];
};</pre>


<p>What's important is that you can see the address family in the
<i><tt class="var">ss_family</tt></i> field—check this to see if it's
<tt class="const">AF_INET</tt> or <tt class="const">AF_INET6</tt> (for IPv4 or
IPv6).  Then you can cast it to a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in</tt></nobr> or
<nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in6</tt></nobr> if you wanna.</p>

 






<h3 class="sect2title">3.4. <a name="ipaddrs2">IP Addresses, Part Deux</a></h3>


<p>Fortunately for you, there are a bunch of functions that allow you to
manipulate <a name="indexId434909-98"></a>IP addresses.  No need to figure them out by
hand and stuff them in a <nobr><tt class="type">long</tt></nobr> with the
<tt class="tt">&lt;&lt;</tt> operator.</p>

<p>First, let's say you have a <nobr><tt class="type">struct sockaddr_in ina</tt></nobr>, and
you have an IP address "<tt class="tt">10.12.110.57</tt>" or
"<tt class="tt">2001:db8:63b3:1::3490</tt>" that you want to store into it.  The
function you want to use, <a name="indexId434909-99"></a>
<b><tt class="func">inet_pton()</tt></b>, converts an IP address in numbers-and-dots
notation into either a <nobr><tt class="type">struct in_addr</tt></nobr> or a <nobr><tt class="type">struct
in6_addr</tt></nobr> depending on whether you specify <tt class="const">AF_INET</tt>
or <tt class="const">AF_INET6</tt>.  ("pton" stands for "presentation to
network"—you can call it "printable to network" if that's easier
to remember.)  The conversion can be made as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">struct sockaddr_in sa; // IPv4
struct sockaddr_in6 sa6; // IPv6

inet_pton(AF_INET, "192.0.2.1", &amp;(sa.sin_addr)); // IPv4
inet_pton(AF_INET6, "2001:db8:63b3:1::3490", &amp;(sa6.sin6_addr)); // IPv6</pre>


<p>(Quick note: the old way of doing things used a function called <a name="indexId434909-100"></a><b><tt class="func">inet_addr()</tt></b> or another function called
<a name="indexId434909-101"></a><b><tt class="func">inet_aton()</tt></b>; these are now obsolete
and don't work with IPv6.)</p>

<p>Now, the above code snippet isn't very robust because there is no
error checking.  See, <b><tt class="func">inet_pton()</tt></b> returns
<tt class="const">-1</tt> on error, or 0 if the address is messed up.  So check
to make sure the result is greater than 0 before using!</p>

<p>All right, now you can convert string IP addresses to their binary
representations.  What about the other way around?  What if you have a
<nobr><tt class="type">struct in_addr</tt></nobr> and you want to print it in numbers-and-dots
notation?   (Or a <nobr><tt class="type">struct in6_addr</tt></nobr> that you want in, uh,
"hex-and-colons" notation.)  In this case, you'll want to use the
function <a name="indexId434909-102"></a><b><tt class="func">inet_ntop()</tt></b> ("ntop" means
"network to presentation"—you can call it "network to printable"
if that's easier to remember), like this:</p>

<pre class="code">// IPv4:

char ip4[INET_ADDRSTRLEN];  // space to hold the IPv4 string
struct sockaddr_in sa;      // pretend this is loaded with something

inet_ntop(AF_INET, &amp;(sa.sin_addr), ip4, INET_ADDRSTRLEN);

printf("The IPv4 address is: %s\n", ip4);


// IPv6:

char ip6[INET6_ADDRSTRLEN]; // space to hold the IPv6 string
struct sockaddr_in6 sa6;    // pretend this is loaded with something

inet_ntop(AF_INET6, &amp;(sa6.sin6_addr), ip6, INET6_ADDRSTRLEN);

printf("The address is: %s\n", ip6);</pre>


<p>When you call it, you'll pass the address type (IPv4 or IPv6), the
address, a pointer to a string to hold the result, and the maximum
length of that string.  (Two macros conveniently hold the size of the
string you'll need to hold the largest IPv4 or IPv6 address:
<tt class="const">INET_ADDRSTRLEN</tt> and <tt class="const">INET6_ADDRSTRLEN</tt>.)</p>

<p>(Another quick note to mention once again the old way of doing
things: the historical function to do this conversion was called <a name="indexId434909-103"></a><b><tt class="func">inet_ntoa()</tt></b>.  It's also obsolete and
won't work with IPv6.)</p>

<p>Lastly, these functions only work with numeric IP
addresses—they won't do any nameserver DNS lookup on a hostname,
like "www.example.com".  You will use <b><tt class="func">getaddrinfo()</tt></b> to do
that, as you'll see later on.</p>



<h4 class="sect3title">3.4.1. <a name="privnet">Private (Or Disconnected) Networks</a></h4>


<p><a name="indexId434909-104"></a>Lots of places have a <a name="indexId434909-105"></a>firewall that hides the network from the rest of the
world for their own protection.  And often times, the firewall
translates "internal" IP addresses to "external" (that everyone else in
the world knows) IP addresses using a process called <i>Network
Address Translation</i>, or <a name="indexId434909-106"></a>NAT.</p>

<p>Are you getting nervous yet?  "Where's he going with all this weird
stuff?"</p>

<p>Well, relax and buy yourself a non-alcoholic (or alcoholic) drink,
because as a beginner, you don't even have to worry about NAT, since
it's done for you transparently.  But I wanted to talk about the network
behind the firewall in case you started getting confused by the network
numbers you were seeing.</p>

<p>For instance, I have a firewall at home.  I have two static IPv4
addresses allocated to me by the DSL company, and yet I have seven
computers on the network.  How is this possible?  Two computers can't
share the same IP address, or else the data wouldn't know which one to
go to!</p>

<p>The answer is: they don't share the same IP addresses.  They are on a
private network with 24 million IP addresses allocated to it.  They are
all just for me.  Well, all for me as far as anyone else is concerned.
Here's what's happening:</p>

<p>If I log into a remote computer, it tells me I'm logged in from
192.0.2.33 which is the public IP address my ISP has provided to me.
But if I ask my local computer what it's IP address is, it says
10.0.0.5.  Who is translating the IP address from one to the other?
That's right, the firewall!  It's doing NAT!</p>

<p>10.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i> is one of a few reserved
networks that are only to be used either on fully disconnected networks,
or on networks that are behind firewalls.  The details of which private
network numbers are available for you to use are outlined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918" target="_blank">RFC 1918</a>,
but some common ones you'll see are <a name="indexId434909-107"></a>10.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i> and <a name="indexId434909-108"></a>192.168.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>, where <i>x</i>
is 0-255, generally.  Less common is
172.<i>y</i>.<i>x</i>.<i>x</i>, where <i>y</i> goes
between 16 and 31.</p>

<p>Networks behind a NATing firewall don't <i>need</i> to be on one
of these reserved networks, but they commonly are.</p>

<p>(Fun fact!  My external IP address isn't really 192.0.2.33.  The
192.0.2.<i>x</i> network is reserved for make-believe "real" IP
addresses to be used in documentation, just like this guide!
Wowzers!)</p>

<p><a name="indexId434909-109"></a>IPv6 has private networks, too, in a sense.  They'll
start with <tt class="tt">fd<i>xx</i>:</tt> (or maybe in the future
<tt class="tt">fc<i>XX</i>:</tt>), as per <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193" target="_blank">RFC 4193</a>.  NAT and IPv6 don't
generally mix, however (unless you're doing the IPv6 to IPv4 gateway
thing which is beyond the scope of this document)—in theory
you'll have so many addresses at your disposal that you won't need to
use NAT any longer.  But if you want to allocate addresses for yourself
on a network that won't route outside, this is how to do it.</p>
