<dt><b>Where can I get those header files?</b></dt>


<dd><p><a name="indexId434909-199"></a>If you don't have them on your system
already, you probably don't need them.  Check the manual for your
particular platform.  If you're building for <a name="indexId434909-200"></a>Windows,
you only need to <tt class="tt">#include &lt;winsock.h&gt;</tt>.</p></dd>







<dt><b>What do I do when <b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b> reports
<a name="indexId434909-201"></a>"Address already in use"?</b></dt>


<dd><p>You have to use <a name="indexId434909-202"></a><b><tt class="func">setsockopt()</tt></b>
with the <a name="indexId434909-203"></a><tt class="const">SO_REUSEADDR</tt> option on
the listening socket.  Check out the <a href="syscalls.html#bind">section on <a name="indexId434909-204"></a><b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b></a> and the <a href="advanced.html#select">section on <a name="indexId434909-205"></a><b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b></a> for an example.</p></dd>







<dt><b>How do I get a list of open sockets on the
system?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Use the <a name="indexId434909-206"></a><b class="com">netstat</b>.  Check the
<b class="com">man</b> page for full details, but you should get some good
output just typing:</p>

<pre class="screen">$ netstat</pre>


<p>The only trick is determining which socket is associated with
which program. <tt>:-)</tt></p></dd>







<dt><b>How can I view the routing table?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Run the <a name="indexId434909-207"></a><b class="com">route</b> command (in
<i><tt class="var">/sbin</tt></i> on most Linuxes) or the command
<a name="indexId434909-208"></a><b class="com">netstat -r</b>.</p></dd>







<dt><b>How can I run the client and server programs if I only
have one computer?  Don't I need a network to write network
programs?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Fortunately for you, virtually all machines implement a <a name="indexId434909-209"></a>loopback network "device" that sits in the kernel
and pretends to be a network card.  (This is the interface listed as
"<tt class="tt">lo</tt>" in the routing table.)</p>

<p>Pretend you're logged into a machine named
<a name="indexId434909-210"></a>"<tt class="tt">goat</tt>".  Run the client in one window
and the server in another.  Or start the server in the background
("<b class="com">server &amp;</b>") and run the client in the same
window.  The upshot of the loopback device is that you can either
<b class="com">client goat</b> or <a name="indexId434909-211"></a><b class="com">client localhost</b>
(since "<tt class="tt">localhost</tt>" is likely defined in
your <i><tt class="var">/etc/hosts</tt></i> file) and you'll have the client
talking to the server without a network!</p>

<p>In short, no changes are necessary to any of the code to make it
run on a single non-networked machine!  Huzzah!</p></dd>







<dt><b>How can I tell if the remote side has closed
connection?</b></dt>


<dd><p>You can tell because <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> will
return <tt class="const">0</tt>.</p></dd>







<dt><b>How do I implement a <a name="indexId434909-212"></a>"ping" utility?  What is <a name="indexId434909-213"></a>ICMP?  Where can I find out more about <a name="indexId434909-214"></a>raw sockets and <tt class="const">SOCK_RAW</tt>?</b></dt>


<dd><p>All your raw sockets questions will be answered in <a href="reference.html#books">W. Richard Stevens' UNIX Network Programming books</a>.
Also, look in the <i><tt class="var">ping/</tt></i> subdirectory in Stevens' UNIX
Network Programming source code, <a href="http://www.unpbook.com/src.html" target="_blank">available
online</a>.</p></dd>







<dt><b>How do I change or shorten the timeout on a call to
<b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Instead of giving you exactly the same answer that W. Richard
Stevens would give you, I'll just refer you to <a href="http://www.unpbook.com/src.html" target="_blank"><i><tt class="var">lib/connect_nonb.c</tt></i> in the UNIX Network
Programming source code</a>.</p>

<p>The gist of it is that you make a socket descriptor with
<b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b>, <a href="advanced.html#blocking">set it to
non-blocking</a>, call <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>, and if all goes well
<b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> will return <tt class="const">-1</tt> immediately and
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> will be set to <tt class="const">EINPROGRESS</tt>.  Then you
call <a href="advanced.html#select"><b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b></a> with whatever
timeout you want, passing the socket descriptor in both the read and
write sets.  If it doesn't timeout, it means the <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>
call completed.  At this point, you'll have to use
<b><tt class="func">getsockopt()</tt></b> with the <tt class="const">SO_ERROR</tt> option to get
the return value from the <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> call, which should be
zero if there was no error.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll probably want to set the socket back to be blocking
again before you start transferring data over it.</p>

<p>Notice that this has the added benefit of allowing your program to do
something else while it's connecting, too.  You could, for example, set
the timeout to something low, like 500 ms, and update an indicator
onscreen each timeout, then call <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> again.  When
you've called <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> and timed-out, say, 20 times, you'll
know it's time to give up on the connection.</p>

<p>Like I said, check out Stevens' source for a perfectly excellent
example.</p></dd>







<dt><b>How do I build for Windows?</b></dt>


<dd><p>First, delete Windows and install Linux or BSD.
<tt>};-)</tt>.  No, actually, just see the <a href="intro.html#windows">section on building for
Windows</a> in the introduction.</p></dd>







<dt><b>How do I build for Solaris/SunOS?  I keep getting linker
errors when I try to compile!</b></dt>


<dd><p>The linker errors happen because Sun boxes don't
automatically compile in the socket libraries.  See the <a href="intro.html#solaris">section on building for Solaris/SunOS</a> in the
introduction for an example of how to do this.</p></dd>







<dt><b>Why does <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> keep falling out
on a signal?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Signals tend to cause blocked system calls to return
<tt class="const">-1</tt> with <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> set to <tt class="const">EINTR</tt>.
When you set up a signal handler with <a name="indexId434909-215"></a><b><tt class="func">sigaction()</tt></b>, you can set the flag <a name="indexId434909-216"></a><tt class="const">SA_RESTART</tt>, which is supposed to
restart the system call after it was interrupted.</p>

<p>Naturally, this doesn't always work.</p>

<p>My favorite solution to this involves a
<a name="indexId434909-217"></a><tt class="tt">goto</tt> statement.  You know this
irritates your professors to no end, so go for it!</p>

<pre class="code">select_restart:
if ((err = select(fdmax+1, &amp;readfds, NULL, NULL, NULL)) == -1) {
    if (errno == EINTR) {
        // some signal just interrupted us, so restart
        goto select_restart;
    }
    // handle the real error here:
    perror("select");
} 
</pre>


<p>Sure, you don't <i>need</i> to use
<tt class="tt">goto</tt> in this case; you can use other
structures to control it.  But I think the
<tt class="tt">goto</tt> statement is actually
cleaner.</p></dd>







<dt><b>How can I implement a <a name="indexId434909-218"></a>timeout on a call to
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Use <a name="indexId434909-219"></a><a href="advanced.html#select"><b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b></a>!  It allows you to specify a
timeout parameter for socket descriptors that you're looking to read
from.  Or, you could wrap the entire functionality in a single function,
like this:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int recvtimeout(int s, char *buf, int len, int timeout)
{
    fd_set fds;
    int n;
    struct timeval tv;

    // set up the file descriptor set
    FD_ZERO(&amp;fds);
    FD_SET(s, &amp;fds);

    // set up the struct timeval for the timeout
    tv.tv_sec = timeout;
    tv.tv_usec = 0;

    // wait until timeout or data received
    n = select(s+1, &amp;fds, NULL, NULL, &amp;tv);
    if (n == 0) return -2; // timeout!
    if (n == -1) return -1; // error

    // data must be here, so do a normal recv()
    return recv(s, buf, len, 0);
}
.
.
.
// Sample call to recvtimeout():
n = recvtimeout(s, buf, sizeof buf, 10); // 10 second timeout

if (n == -1) {
    // error occurred
    perror("recvtimeout");
}
else if (n == -2) {
    // timeout occurred
} else {
    // got some data in buf
}
.
.
. 
</pre>


<p>Notice that <a name="indexId434909-220"></a><b><tt class="func">recvtimeout()</tt></b>
returns <tt class="const">-2</tt> in case of a timeout.  Why not return
<tt class="const">0</tt>?  Well, if you recall, a return value of
<tt class="const">0</tt> on a call to <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> means that the remote
side closed the connection.  So that return value is already spoken for,
and <tt class="const">-1</tt> means "error", so I chose <tt class="const">-2</tt> as my
timeout indicator.</p>

</dd>











<dt><b>How do I <a name="indexId434909-221"></a>encrypt or compress the data before
sending it through the socket?</b></dt>


<dd>

<p>One easy way to do encryption is to use <a name="indexId434909-222"></a>SSL (secure
sockets layer), but that's beyond the scope of this guide.  (<a name="indexId434909-223"></a>Check out the <a href="http://www.openssl.org/" target="_blank">OpenSSL
project</a> for more info.)</p>

<p>But assuming you want to plug in or implement your own <a name="indexId434909-224"></a>compressor
or encryption system, it's just a matter of thinking of your data as
running through a sequence of steps between both ends.  Each step
changes the data in some way.</p>

<ol>

<li>server reads data from file (or wherever)</li>

<li>server encrypts/compresses data  (you add this part)</li>

<li>server <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>s encrypted data</li>

</ol>


<p>Now the other way around:</p>

<ol>

<li>client <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>s encrypted data</li>

<li>client decrypts/decompresses data  (you add this part)</li>

<li>client writes data to file (or wherever)</li>

</ol>


<p>If you're going to compress and encrypt, just remember to compress
first.  <tt>:-)</tt></p>

<p>Just as long as the client properly undoes what the server does,
the data will be fine in the end no matter how many intermediate steps
you add.</p>

<p>So all you need to do to use my code is to find the place between
where the data is read and the data is sent (using
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>) over the network, and stick some code in
there that does the encryption.</p>

<dt><b><a name="indexId434909-225"></a><a name="indexId434909-226"></a>What is this
"<tt class="const">PF_INET</tt>" I keep seeing?  Is it related to
<tt class="const">AF_INET</tt>?</b></dt>


<dd>
<p>Yes, yes it is.  See <a href="syscalls.html#socket">the section on
<b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b></a> for details.</p>

</dd>








<dt><b>How can I write a server that accepts shell commands
from a client and executes them?</b></dt>


<dd>

<p>For simplicity, lets say the client
<b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b>s, <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>s, and
<b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b>s the connection (that is, there are no
subsequent system calls without the client connecting again.)</p>

<p>The process the client follows is this:</p>

<ol>

<li><b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> to server</li>

<li><b><tt class="func">send("/sbin/ls &gt; /tmp/client.out")</tt></b></li>

<li><b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b> the connection</li>

</ol>


<p>Meanwhile, the server is handling the data and executing
it:</p>

<ol>

<li><b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> the connection from the client</li>

<li><b><tt class="func">recv(str)</tt></b> the command string</li>

<li><b><tt class="func">close()</tt></b> the connection</li>

<li><b><tt class="func">system(str)</tt></b> to run the command</li>

</ol>


<p><a name="indexId434909-227"></a><i>Beware!</i>  Having the server execute
what the client says is like giving remote shell access and people can
do things to your account when they connect to the server.  For
instance, in the above example, what if the client sends "<b class="com">rm -rf
~</b>"?  It deletes everything in your account, that's what!</p>

<p>So you get wise, and you prevent the client from using any except
for a couple utilities that you know are safe, like the
<b class="com">foobar</b> utility:</p>

<pre class="code">if (!strncmp(str, "foobar", 6)) {
    sprintf(sysstr, "%s &gt; /tmp/server.out", str);
    system(sysstr);
} 
</pre>


<p>But you're still unsafe, unfortunately: what if the client enters
"<b class="com">foobar; rm -rf ~</b>"?  The safest thing to do is to
write a little routine that puts an escape ("<tt class="const">\</tt>")
character in front of all non-alphanumeric characters (including spaces,
if appropriate) in the arguments for the command.</p>

<p>As you can see, security is a pretty big issue when the server
starts executing things the client sends.</p>

</dd>








<dt><b>I'm sending a slew of data, but when I
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>, it only receives 536 bytes or 1460 bytes at
a time.  But if I run it on my local machine, it receives all the data
at the same time.  What's going on?</b></dt>


<dd>

<p>You're hitting the <a name="indexId434909-228"></a>MTU—the maximum size the
physical medium can handle.  On the local machine, you're using the
loopback device which can handle 8K or more no problem.  But on
Ethernet, which can only handle 1500 bytes with a header, you hit that
limit.  Over a modem, with 576 MTU (again, with header), you hit the
even lower limit.</p>

<p>You have to make sure all the data is being sent, first of all.
(See the <a href="advanced.html#sendall"><b><tt class="func">sendall()</tt></b></a>
function implementation for details.) Once you're sure of that, then you
need to call <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> in a loop until all your data
is read.</p>

<p>Read the section <a href="advanced.html#sonofdataencap">Son of Data
Encapsulation</a> for details on receiving complete packets of data
using multiple calls to <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>.</p>

<dt><b>I'm on a Windows box and I don't have the
<b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> system call or any kind of <nobr><tt class="type">struct
sigaction</tt></nobr>.  What to do?</b></dt>


<dd>
<p><a name="indexId434909-229"></a>If they're anywhere, they'll be in POSIX libraries
that may have shipped with your compiler.  Since I don't have a Windows
box, I really can't tell you the answer, but I seem to remember that
Microsoft has a POSIX compatibility layer and that's where
<b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b> would be.  (And maybe even
<nobr><tt class="type">sigaction</tt></nobr>.)</p>

<p>Search the help that came with VC++ for "fork" or "POSIX" and see if it
gives you any clues.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work at all, ditch the
<b><tt class="func">fork()</tt></b>/<nobr><tt class="type">sigaction</tt></nobr> stuff and replace it with the
Win32 equivalent: <a name="indexId434909-230"></a><b><tt class="func">CreateProcess()</tt></b>.  I don't know how
to use <b><tt class="func">CreateProcess()</tt></b>—it takes a bazillion
arguments, but it should be covered in the docs that came with VC++.</p>

<dt><b><a name="indexId434909-231"></a>I'm behind a firewall—how do I let people
outside the firewall know my IP address so they can connect to my
machine?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Unfortunately, the purpose of a firewall is to prevent
people outside the firewall from connecting to machines inside the
firewall, so allowing them to do so is basically considered a breach of
security.</p>

<p>This isn't to say that all is lost.  For one thing, you can still
often <b><tt class="func">connect()</tt></b> through the firewall if it's doing
some kind of masquerading or NAT or something like that.  Just design
your programs so that you're always the one initiating the connection,
and you'll be fine.</p>

<p><a name="indexId434909-232"></a>If that's not satisfactory, you
can ask your sysadmins to poke a hole in the firewall so that people can
connect to you.  The firewall can forward to you either through it's NAT
software, or through a proxy or something like that.</p>

<p>Be aware that a hole in the firewall is nothing to be taken
lightly.  You have to make sure you don't give bad people access to the
internal network; if you're a beginner, it's a lot harder to make
software secure than you might imagine.</p>

<p>Don't make your sysadmin mad at me.

<dt><b><a name="indexId434909-233"></a><a name="indexId434909-234"></a>How do I write
a packet sniffer?  How do I put my Ethernet interface into promiscuous
mode?</b></dt>


<dd><p>For those not in the know, when a network card is in "promiscuous
mode", it will forward ALL packets to the operating system, not just
those that were addressed to this particular machine.  (We're talking
Ethernet-layer addresses here, not IP addresses--but since ethernet is
lower-layer than IP, all IP addresses are effectively forwarded as
well.  See the section <a href="theory.html#lowlevel">Low Level Nonsense and
Network Theory</a> for more info.)</p>

<p>This is the basis for how a packet sniffer works.  It puts the
interface into promiscuous mode, then the OS gets every single packet
that goes by on the wire.  You'll have a socket of some type that you
can read this data from.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the answer to the question varies depending on the
platform, but if you Google for, for instance, "windows promiscuous <a name="indexId434909-235"></a>ioctl" you'll probably get somewhere.  There's what looks
like <a href="http://interactive.linuxjournal.com/article/4659" target="_blank">a decent writeup in Linux Journal</a>,
as well.</p></dd>






<dt><b>How can I set a custom <a name="indexId434909-236"></a>timeout value for
a TCP or UDP socket?</b></dt>


<dd><p>It depends on your system.  You might search the net for <a name="indexId434909-237"></a><tt class="const">SO_RCVTIMEO</tt> and <a name="indexId434909-238"></a><tt class="const">SO_SNDTIMEO</tt> (for use with <a name="indexId434909-239"></a><b><tt class="func">setsockopt()</tt></b>) to see if your system
supports such functionality.</p>

<p>The Linux man page suggests using <b><tt class="func">alarm()</tt></b> or
<b><tt class="func">setitimer()</tt></b> as a substitute.</p>

</dd>






<dt><b>How can I tell which ports are available to use?  Is there a list of
"official" port numbers?</b></dt>


<dd><p>Usually this isn't an issue.  If you're writing, say, a web
server, then it's a good idea to use the well-known port 80 for your
software.  If you're writing just your own specialized server, then
choose a port at random (but greater than 1023) and give it a try.</p>

<p>If the port is already in use, you'll get an "Address already in use"
error when you try to <b><tt class="func">bind()</tt></b>.  Choose another port.  (It's
a good idea to allow the user of your software to specify an alternate
port either with a config file or a command line switch.)</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/port-numbers" target="_blank">list of official port
numbers</a> maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
(IANA).  Just because something (over 1023) is in that list doesn't mean
you can't use the port.  For instance, Id Software's DOOM uses the same
port as "mdqs", whatever that is.  All that matters is that no one else
<i>on the same machine</i> is using that port when you want to use
it.</p>
