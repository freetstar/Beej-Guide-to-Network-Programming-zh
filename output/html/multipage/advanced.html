<h2 class="sect1title">7. <a name="advanced">Slightly Advanced Techniques</a></h2><hr class="mainsecthr"/>


<p>These aren't <i>really</i> advanced, but they're
getting out of the more basic levels we've already covered.  In fact, if
you've gotten this far, you should consider yourself fairly accomplished
in the basics of Unix network programming!  Congratulations!</p>

<p>So here we go into the brave new world of some of the more
esoteric things you might want to learn about sockets.  Have at
it!</p>







<h3 class="sect2title">7.1. <a name="blocking">Blocking</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-164"></a>Blocking.  You've heard about it—now what
the heck is it?  In a nutshell, "block" is techie jargon for "sleep".
You probably noticed that when you run <b class="com">listener</b>, above, it
just sits there until a packet arrives.  What happened is that it called
<b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b>, there was no data, and so
<b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b> is said to "block" (that is, sleep there) until
some data arrives.</p>

<p>Lots of functions block.  <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> blocks.
All the <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> functions block.  The reason they
can do this is because they're allowed to.  When you first create the
socket descriptor with <b><tt class="func">socket()</tt></b>, the kernel sets it
to blocking.  <a name="indexId434909-165"></a>If you don't want a socket to be blocking, you have to
make a call to <a name="indexId434909-166"></a><b><tt class="func">fcntl()</tt></b>:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
.
.
.
sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK);
.
.
. 
</pre>


<p>By setting a socket to non-blocking, you can effectively "poll"
the socket for information.  If you try to read from a non-blocking
socket and there's no data there, it's not allowed to block—it
will return <tt class="const">-1</tt> and <i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> will be set to
<a name="indexId434909-167"></a><tt class="const">EWOULDBLOCK</tt>.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, however, this type of polling is a bad idea.
If you put your program in a busy-wait looking for data on the socket,
you'll suck up CPU time like it was going out of style.  A more elegant
solution for checking to see if there's data waiting to be read comes in
the following section on <a name="indexId434909-168"></a><b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b>.</p>









<h3 class="sect2title">7.2. <a name="select"><b><tt class="titlefunc">select()</tt></b>—Synchronous I/O Multiplexing</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-169"></a>This function is somewhat strange, but it's very
useful.  Take the following situation: you are a server and you want to
listen for incoming connections as well as keep reading from the
connections you already have.</p>

<p>No problem, you say, just an <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> and a
couple of <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>s.  Not so fast, buster!  What if
you're blocking on an <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> call?  How are you
going to <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> data at the same time?  "Use
non-blocking sockets!"  No way!  You don't want to be a CPU hog.  What,
then?</p>

<p><b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> gives you the power to monitor
several sockets at the same time.  It'll tell you which ones are ready
for reading, which are ready for writing, and which sockets have raised
exceptions, if you really want to know that.</p>

<p>This being said, in modern times <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b>, though very
portable, is one of the slowest methods for monitoring sockets.  One
possible alternative is <a href="http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/" target="_blank">libevent</a>, or
something similar, that encapsulates all the system-dependent stuff
involved with getting socket notifications.</p>

<p>Without any further ado, I'll offer the synopsis of
<b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b>:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int select(int numfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,
           fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout); 
</pre>


<p>The function monitors "sets" of file descriptors; in particular
<i><tt class="var">readfds</tt></i>, <i><tt class="var">writefds</tt></i>, and
<i><tt class="var">exceptfds</tt></i>.  If you want to see if you can read
from standard input and some socket descriptor,
<i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i>, just add the file descriptors
<tt class="const">0</tt> and <i><tt class="var">sockfd</tt></i> to the set
<i><tt class="var">readfds</tt></i>.  The parameter
<i><tt class="var">numfds</tt></i> should be set to the values of the highest
file descriptor plus one.  In this example, it should be set to
<i><tt class="var">sockfd+1</tt></i>, since it is assuredly higher than
standard input (<tt class="const">0</tt>).</p>

<p>When <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> returns,
<i><tt class="var">readfds</tt></i> will be modified to reflect which of the
file descriptors you selected which is ready for reading.  You can test
them with the macro <b><tt class="func">FD_ISSET()</tt></b>, below.</p>

<p>Before progressing much further, I'll talk about how to manipulate
these sets.  Each set is of the type <nobr><tt class="type">fd_set</tt></nobr>.  The following
macros operate on this type:</p>

<p><center><table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="joetable">

<tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="50%%"><p><a name="indexId434909-170"></a><b><tt class="func">FD_SET(int fd, fd_set *set);</tt></b></p></td>

<td valign="top" align="left" width="48%%"><p>Add <i><tt class="var">fd</tt></i> to the <i><tt class="var">set</tt></i>.</p></td>
</tr>


<tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p><a name="indexId434909-171"></a><b><tt class="func">FD_CLR(int fd, fd_set *set);</tt></b></p></td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><p>Remove <i><tt class="var">fd</tt></i> from the <i><tt class="var">set</tt></i>.</p></td>
</tr>


<tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p><a name="indexId434909-172"></a><b><tt class="func">FD_ISSET(int fd, fd_set *set);</tt></b></p></td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><p>Return true if <i><tt class="var">fd</tt></i> is in the
<i><tt class="var">set</tt></i>.</p></td>
</tr>


<tr><td valign="top" align="left"><p><a name="indexId434909-173"></a><b><tt class="func">FD_ZERO(fd_set *set);</tt></b></p></td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><p>Clear all entries from the <i><tt class="var">set</tt></i>.</p></td>
</tr>

</table></center>
</p>

<p>Finally, what is this weirded out <a name="indexId434909-174"></a>
<nobr><tt class="type">struct timeval</tt></nobr>?
Well, sometimes you don't want to wait forever for someone to send you
some data.  Maybe every 96 seconds you want to print "Still Going..." to
the terminal even though nothing has happened.  This time structure
allows you to specify a timeout period.  If the time is exceeded and
<b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> still hasn't found any ready file
descriptors, it'll return so you can continue processing.</p>

<p>The <nobr><tt class="type">struct timeval</tt></nobr> has the follow fields:</p>

<pre class="code">struct timeval {
    int tv_sec;     // seconds
    int tv_usec;    // microseconds
}; 
</pre>


<p>Just set <i><tt class="var">tv_sec</tt></i> to the number of seconds to
wait, and set <i><tt class="var">tv_usec</tt></i> to the number of
microseconds to wait.  Yes, that's <i>micro</i>seconds,
not milliseconds.  There are 1,000 microseconds in a millisecond, and
1,000 milliseconds in a second.  Thus, there are 1,000,000 microseconds
in a second.  Why is it "usec"?  The "u" is supposed to look like the
Greek letter &#x03BC; (Mu) that we use for "micro".  Also, when the function
returns, <i><tt class="var">timeout</tt></i> <i>might</i> be
updated to show the time still remaining.  This depends on what flavor
of Unix you're running.</p>

<p>Yay!  We have a microsecond resolution timer!  Well, don't count on
it.  You'll probably have to wait some part of your standard Unix
timeslice no matter how small you set your <nobr><tt class="type">struct
timeval</tt></nobr>.</p>

<p>Other things of interest:  If you set the fields in your
<nobr><tt class="type">struct timeval</tt></nobr> to <tt class="const">0</tt>,
<b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> will timeout immediately, effectively
polling all the file descriptors in your sets.  If you set the
parameter <i><tt class="var">timeout</tt></i> to NULL, it will never timeout,
and will wait until the first file descriptor is ready.  Finally, if you
don't care about waiting for a certain set, you can just set it to NULL
in the call to <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b>.</p>

<p><a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/select.c" target="_blank">The following code snippet</a> waits 2.5 seconds for
something to appear on standard input:</p>

<pre class="code">/*
** select.c -- a select() demo
*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define STDIN 0  // file descriptor for standard input

int main(void)
{
    struct timeval tv;
    fd_set readfds;

    tv.tv_sec = 2;
    tv.tv_usec = 500000;

    FD_ZERO(&amp;readfds);
    FD_SET(STDIN, &amp;readfds);

    // don't care about writefds and exceptfds:
    select(STDIN+1, &amp;readfds, NULL, NULL, &amp;tv);

    if (FD_ISSET(STDIN, &amp;readfds))
        printf("A key was pressed!\n");
    else
        printf("Timed out.\n");

    return 0;
} 
</pre>


<p>If you're on a line buffered terminal, the key you hit should be
RETURN or it will time out anyway.</p>

<p>Now, some of you might think this is a great way to wait for data
on a datagram socket—and you are right: it <i>might</i> be.
Some Unices can use select in this manner, and some can't.  You should
see what your local man page says on the matter if you want to attempt
it.</p>

<p>Some Unices update the time in your <nobr><tt class="type">struct timeval</tt></nobr> to
reflect the amount of time still remaining before a timeout.  But others
do not.  Don't rely on that occurring if you want to be portable.  (Use
<a name="indexId434909-175"></a><b><tt class="func">gettimeofday()</tt></b> if you need to
track time elapsed.  It's a bummer, I know, but that's the way it
is.)</p>

<p>What happens if a socket in the read set closes the connection?
Well, in that case, <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> returns with that
socket descriptor set as "ready to read".  When you actually do
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> from it, <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> will
return <tt class="const">0</tt>.  That's how you know the client has
closed the connection.</p>

<p>One more note of interest about <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b>: if you have a
socket that is <a name="indexId434909-176"></a>
<a name="indexId434909-177"></a> <b><tt class="func">listen()</tt></b>ing, you can
check to see if there is a new connection by putting that socket's file
descriptor in the <i><tt class="var">readfds</tt></i> set.</p>

<p>And that, my friends, is a quick overview of the almighty
<b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> function.</p>

<p>But, by popular demand, here is an in-depth example.
Unfortunately, the difference between the dirt-simple example, above, and
this one here is significant.  But have a look, then read the
description that follows it.</p>

<p><a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/selectserver.c" target="_blank">This program</a> acts
like a simple multi-user chat server.  Start it running in one window,
then <b class="com">telnet</b> to it ("<b class="com">telnet hostname

in one <b class="com">telnet</b> session, it should appear in all the
others.</p>

<p>Notice I have two file descriptor sets in the code:
<i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> and <i><tt class="var">read_fds</tt></i>.  The
first, <i><tt class="var">master</tt></i>, holds all the socket descriptors
that are currently connected, as well as the socket descriptor that is
listening for new connections.</p>

<p>The reason I have the <i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> set is that
<b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> actually <i>changes</i> the
set you pass into it to reflect which sockets are ready to read.  Since
I have to keep track of the connections from one call of
<b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> to the next, I must store these safely
away somewhere.  At the last minute, I copy the
<i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> into the <i><tt class="var">read_fds</tt></i>,
and then call <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b>.</p>

<p>But doesn't this mean that every time I get a new connection, I
have to add it to the <i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> set?  Yup!  And
every time a connection closes, I have to remove it from the
<i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> set?  Yes, it does.</p>

<p>Notice I check to see when the <i><tt class="var">listener</tt></i>
socket is ready to read.  When it is, it means I have a new connection
pending, and I <b><tt class="func">accept()</tt></b> it and add it to the
<i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> set.  Similarly, when a client connection
is ready to read, and <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> returns
<tt class="const">0</tt>, I know the client has closed the connection, and
I must remove it from the <i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> set.</p>

<p>If the client <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> returns non-zero,
though, I know some data has been received.  So I get it, and then go
through the <i><tt class="var">master</tt></i> list and send that data to all
the rest of the connected clients.</p>

<p>And that, my friends, is a less-than-simple overview of the
almighty <b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> function.</p>

<p>In addition, here is a bonus afterthought: there is another function
called <a name="indexId434909-178"></a><b><tt class="func">poll()</tt></b> which behaves much the same way
<b><tt class="func">select()</tt></b> does, but with a different system for managing the
file descriptor sets.  <a href="pollman.html">Check it out!</a></p>









<h3 class="sect2title">7.3. <a name="sendall">Handling Partial <b><tt class="titlefunc">send()</tt></b>s</a></h3>


<p>Remember back in the <a href="syscalls.html#sendrecv">section about
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b></a>, above, when I said that
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> might not send all the bytes you asked it
to?  That is, you want it to send 512 bytes, but it returns 412.  What
happened to the remaining 100 bytes?</p>

<p>Well, they're still in your little buffer waiting to be sent out.
Due to circumstances beyond your control, the kernel decided not to send
all the data out in one chunk, and now, my friend, it's up to you to get
the data out there.</p>

<p><a name="indexId434909-179"></a>You could write a function like this to do it,
too:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;

int sendall(int s, char *buf, int *len)
{
    int total = 0;        // how many bytes we've sent
    int bytesleft = *len; // how many we have left to send
    int n;

    while(total &lt; *len) {
        n = send(s, buf+total, bytesleft, 0);
        if (n == -1) { break; }
        total += n;
        bytesleft -= n;
    }

    *len = total; // return number actually sent here

    return n==-1?-1:0; // return -1 on failure, 0 on success
} 
</pre>


<p>In this example, <i><tt class="var">s</tt></i> is the socket you want
to send the data to, <i><tt class="var">buf</tt></i> is the buffer containing
the data, and <i><tt class="var">len</tt></i> is a pointer to an
<nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr> containing the number of bytes in the buffer.</p>

<p>The function returns <tt class="const">-1</tt> on error (and
<i><tt class="var">errno</tt></i> is still set from the call to
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>.)  Also, the number of bytes actually sent
is returned in <i><tt class="var">len</tt></i>.  This will be the same number
of bytes you asked it to send, unless there was an error.
<b><tt class="func">sendall()</tt></b> will do it's best, huffing and puffing,
to send the data out, but if there's an error, it gets back to you right
away.</p>

<p>For completeness, here's a sample call to the function:</p>

<pre class="code">char buf[10] = "Beej!";
int len;

len = strlen(buf);
if (sendall(s, buf, &amp;len) == -1) {
    perror("sendall");
    printf("We only sent %d bytes because of the error!\n", len);
} 
</pre>


<p>What happens on the receiver's end when part of a packet arrives?
If the packets are variable length, how does the receiver know when one
packet ends and another begins?  Yes, real-world scenarios are a royal
pain in the <a name="indexId434909-180"></a>donkeys.  You probably have to <a name="indexId434909-181"></a><i>encapsulate</i> (remember that from the

at the beginning?)  Read on for details!</p>









<h3 class="sect2title">7.4. <a name="serialization">Serialization—How to Pack Data</a></h3>


<p><a name="indexId434909-182"></a>It's easy enough to send text data across
the network, you're finding, but what happens if you want to send some
"binary" data like <nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr>s or <nobr><tt class="type">float</tt></nobr>s?  It turns
out you have a few options.</p>

<ol>

<li>Convert the number into text with a function like
<b><tt class="func">sprintf()</tt></b>, then send the text.  The receiver will parse the
text back into a number using a function like
<b><tt class="func">strtol()</tt></b>.</li>


<li>Just send the data raw, passing a pointer to the data to
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b>.</li>


<li>Encode the number into a portable binary form.  The receiver will
decode it.</li>

</ol>


<p>Sneak preview!  Tonight only!</p>

<p>[<i>Curtain raises</i>]</p>

<p>Beej says, "I prefer Method Three, above!"</p>

<p>[<i>THE END</i>]</p>

<p>(Before I begin this section in earnest, I should tell you that there
are libraries out there for doing this, and rolling your own and
remaining portable and error-free is quite a challenge.  So hunt around
and do your homework before deciding to implement this stuff yourself.
I include the information here for those curious about how things like
this work.)</p>

<p>Actually all the methods, above, have their drawbacks and advantages,
but, like I said, in general, I prefer the third method.  First, though,
let's talk about some of the drawbacks and advantages to the other two.</p>

<p>The first method, encoding the numbers as text before sending, has
the advantage that you can easily print and read the data that's coming
over the wire.  Sometimes a human-readable protocol is excellent to use
in a non-bandwidth-intensive situation, such as with <a name="indexId434909-183"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_blank">Internet Relay Chat (IRC)</a>.
However, it has the disadvantage that it is slow to convert, and the
results almost always take up more space than the original number!</p>

<p>Method two: passing the raw data.  This one is quite easy (but
dangerous!): just take a pointer to the data to send, and call send with
it.</p>

<pre class="code">double d = 3490.15926535;

send(s, &amp;d, sizeof d, 0);  /* DANGER--non-portable! */</pre>


<p>The receiver gets it like this:</p>

<pre class="code">double d;

recv(s, &amp;d, sizeof d, 0);  /* DANGER--non-portable! */</pre>


<p>Fast, simple—what's not to like?  Well, it turns out that not
all architectures represent a <nobr><tt class="type">double</tt></nobr> (or <nobr><tt class="type">int</tt></nobr>
for that matter) with the same bit representation or even the same byte
ordering!  The code is decidedly non-portable.  (Hey—maybe you
don't need portability, in which case this is nice and fast.)</p>

<p>When packing integer types, we've already seen how the <a name="indexId434909-184"></a><b><tt class="func">htons()</tt></b>-class of functions can help keep
things portable by transforming the numbers into <a name="indexId434909-185"></a>
Network Byte Order, and how that's the Right Thing to do.
Unfortunately, there are no similar functions for <nobr><tt class="type">float</tt></nobr>
types.  Is all hope lost?</p>

<p>Fear not!  (Were you afraid there for a second?  No?  Not even a
little bit?)  There is something we can do: we can pack (or "marshal",
or "serialize", or one of a thousand million other names) the data into
a known binary format that the receiver can unpack on the remote
side.</p>

<p>What do I mean by "known binary format"?  Well, we've already seen
the <b><tt class="func">htons()</tt></b> example, right?  It changes (or "encodes", if
you want to think of it that way) a number from whatever the host format
is into Network Byte Order.  To reverse (unencode) the number, the
receiver calls <b><tt class="func">ntohs()</tt></b>.</p>

<p>But didn't I just get finished saying there wasn't any such function
for other non-integer types?  Yes.  I did.  And since there's no
standard way in C to do this, it's a bit of a pickle (that a gratuitous
pun there for you Python fans).</p>

<p>The thing to do is to pack the data into a known format and send that
over the wire for decoding.  For example, to pack <nobr><tt class="type">float</tt></nobr>s,
here's <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/pack.c" target="_blank">something quick and dirty with
plenty of room for improvement:</a></p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;

uint32_t htonf(float f)
{
    uint32_t p;
    uint32_t sign;

    if (f &lt; 0) { sign = 1; f = -f; }
    else { sign = 0; }
        
    p = ((((uint32_t)f)&amp;0x7fff)&lt;&lt;16) | (sign&lt;&lt;31); // whole part and sign
    p |= (uint32_t)(((f - (int)f) * 65536.0f))&amp;0xffff; // fraction

    return p;
}

float ntohf(uint32_t p)
{
    float f = ((p&gt;&gt;16)&amp;0x7fff); // whole part
    f += (p&amp;0xffff) / 65536.0f; // fraction

    if (((p&gt;&gt;31)&amp;0x1) == 0x1) { f = -f; } // sign bit set

    return f;
}</pre>


<p>The above code is sort of a naive implementation that stores a
<nobr><tt class="type">float</tt></nobr> in a 32-bit number.  The high bit (31) is used to
store the sign of the number ("1" means negative), and the next seven
bits (30-16) are used to store the whole number portion of the
<nobr><tt class="type">float</tt></nobr>.  Finally, the remaining bits (15-0) are used to
store the fractional portion of the number.</p>

<p>Usage is fairly straightforward:</p>

<pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    float f = 3.1415926, f2;
    uint32_t netf;

    netf = htonf(f);  // convert to "network" form
    f2 = ntohf(netf); // convert back to test

    printf("Original: %f\n", f);        // 3.141593
    printf(" Network: 0x%08X\n", netf); // 0x0003243F
    printf("Unpacked: %f\n", f2);       // 3.141586

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>On the plus side, it's small, simple, and fast.  On the minus side,
it's not an efficient use of space and the range is severely
restricted—try storing a number greater-than 32767 in there and
it won't be very happy!  You can also see in the above example that the
last couple decimal places are not correctly preserved.</p>

<p>What can we do instead?  Well, <i>The</i> Standard for storing
floating point numbers is known as <a name="indexId434909-186"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754" target="_blank">IEEE-754</a>.  Most computers use this format
internally for doing floating point math, so in those cases, strictly
speaking, conversion wouldn't need to be done.  But if you want your
source code to be portable, that's an assumption you can't necessarily
make.  (On the other hand, if you want things to be fast, you should
optimize this out on platforms that don't need to do it!  That's what
<b><tt class="func">htons()</tt></b> and its ilk do.)</p>

<p><a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/ieee754.c" target="_blank">Here's some code that encodes
floats and doubles into IEEE-754 format</a>.  (Mostly—it
doesn't encode NaN or Infinity, but it could be modified to do
that.)</p>

<pre class="code">#define pack754_32(f) (pack754((f), 32, 8))
#define pack754_64(f) (pack754((f), 64, 11))
#define unpack754_32(i) (unpack754((i), 32, 8))
#define unpack754_64(i) (unpack754((i), 64, 11))

uint64_t pack754(long double f, unsigned bits, unsigned expbits)
{
    long double fnorm;
    int shift;
    long long sign, exp, significand;
    unsigned significandbits = bits - expbits - 1; // -1 for sign bit

    if (f == 0.0) return 0; // get this special case out of the way

    // check sign and begin normalization
    if (f &lt; 0) { sign = 1; fnorm = -f; }
    else { sign = 0; fnorm = f; }

    // get the normalized form of f and track the exponent
    shift = 0;
    while(fnorm &gt;= 2.0) { fnorm /= 2.0; shift++; }
    while(fnorm &lt; 1.0) { fnorm *= 2.0; shift--; }
    fnorm = fnorm - 1.0;

    // calculate the binary form (non-float) of the significand data
    significand = fnorm * ((1LL&lt;&lt;significandbits) + 0.5f);

    // get the biased exponent
    exp = shift + ((1&lt;&lt;(expbits-1)) - 1); // shift + bias

    // return the final answer
    return (sign&lt;&lt;(bits-1)) | (exp&lt;&lt;(bits-expbits-1)) | significand;
}

long double unpack754(uint64_t i, unsigned bits, unsigned expbits)
{
    long double result;
    long long shift;
    unsigned bias;
    unsigned significandbits = bits - expbits - 1; // -1 for sign bit

    if (i == 0) return 0.0;

    // pull the significand
    result = (i&amp;((1LL&lt;&lt;significandbits)-1)); // mask
    result /= (1LL&lt;&lt;significandbits); // convert back to float
    result += 1.0f; // add the one back on

    // deal with the exponent
    bias = (1&lt;&lt;(expbits-1)) - 1;
    shift = ((i&gt;&gt;significandbits)&amp;((1LL&lt;&lt;expbits)-1)) - bias;
    while(shift &gt; 0) { result *= 2.0; shift--; }
    while(shift &lt; 0) { result /= 2.0; shift++; }

    // sign it
    result *= (i&gt;&gt;(bits-1))&amp;1? -1.0: 1.0;

    return result;
}</pre>


<p>I put some handy macros up there at the top for packing and unpacking
32-bit (probably a <nobr><tt class="type">float</tt></nobr>) and 64-bit (probably a
<nobr><tt class="type">double</tt></nobr>) numbers, but the <b><tt class="func">pack754()</tt></b> function
could be called directly and told to encode <i><tt class="var">bits</tt></i>-worth of
data (<i><tt class="var">expbits</tt></i> of which are reserved for the normalized
number's exponent.)</p>

<p>Here's sample usage:</p>

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdint.h&gt; // defines uintN_t types
#include &lt;inttypes.h&gt; // defines PRIx macros

int main(void)
{
    float f = 3.1415926, f2;
    double d = 3.14159265358979323, d2;
    uint32_t fi;
    uint64_t di;

    fi = pack754_32(f);
    f2 = unpack754_32(fi);

    di = pack754_64(d);
    d2 = unpack754_64(di);

    printf("float before : %.7f\n", f);
    printf("float encoded: 0x%08" PRIx32 "\n", fi);
    printf("float after  : %.7f\n\n", f2);

    printf("double before : %.20lf\n", d);
    printf("double encoded: 0x%016" PRIx64 "\n", di);
    printf("double after  : %.20lf\n", d2);

    return 0;
}</pre>


<p>The above code produces this output:</p>

<pre class="screen">float before : 3.1415925
float encoded: 0x40490FDA
float after  : 3.1415925

double before : 3.14159265358979311600
double encoded: 0x400921FB54442D18
double after  : 3.14159265358979311600</pre>


<p>Another question you might have is how do you pack
<nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>s?  Unfortunately for you, the compiler is free to
put padding all over the place in a <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr>, and that means
you can't portably send the whole thing over the wire in one chunk.
(Aren't you getting sick of hearing "can't do this", "can't do that"?
Sorry!  To quote a friend, "Whenever anything goes wrong, I always blame
Microsoft."  This one might not be Microsoft's fault, admittedly, but my
friend's statement is completely true.)</p>

<p>Back to it: the best way to send the <nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr> over the
wire is to pack each field independently and then unpack them into the
<nobr><tt class="type">struct</tt></nobr> when they arrive on the other side.</p>

<p>That's a lot of work, is what you're thinking.  Yes, it is.  One
thing you can do is write a helper function to help pack the data for
you.  It'll be fun!  Really!</p>

<p>In the book "<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/" target="_blank">The Practice of
Programming</a>" by Kernighan and Pike, they implement
<b><tt class="func">printf()</tt></b>-like functions called <b><tt class="func">pack()</tt></b>  and
<b><tt class="func">unpack()</tt></b> that do exactly this.  I'd link to them, but
apparently those functions aren't online with the rest of the
source from the book.</p>

<p>(The Practice of Programming is an excellent read.  Zeus saves a
kitten every time I recommend it.)</p>

<p>At this point, I'm going to drop a pointer to the BSD-licensed <a href="http://tpl.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Typed Parameter Language C API</a> which I've never
used, but looks completely respectable.  Python and Perl programmers
will want to check out their language's <b><tt class="func">pack()</tt></b> and
<b><tt class="func">unpack()</tt></b> functions for accomplishing the same thing.  And
Java has a big-ol' Serializable interface that can be used in a similar
way.</p>

<p>But if you want to write your own packing utility in C, K&amp;P's
trick is to use variable argument lists to make
<b><tt class="func">printf()</tt></b>-like functions to build the packets.  <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/pack2.c" target="_blank">Here's a version I cooked up</a> on my own
based on that which hopefully will be enough to give you an idea of how
such a thing can work.</p>

<p>(This code references the <b><tt class="func">pack754()</tt></b> functions, above.

<p>And <a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/pack2.c" target="_blank">here is a demonstration
program</a> of the above code that packs some data into
<i><tt class="var">buf</tt></i> and then unpacks it into variables.  Note that when
calling <b><tt class="func">unpack()</tt></b> with a string argument (format specifier
"<tt class="const">s</tt>"), it's wise to put a maximum length count in front of
it to prevent a buffer overrun, e.g. "<tt class="const">96s</tt>".  Be wary when
unpacking data you get over the network—a malicious user might
send badly-constructed packets in an effort to attack your system!</p>

<p>Whether you roll your own code or use someone else's, it's a good
idea to have a general set of data packing routines for the sake of
keeping bugs in check, rather than packing each bit by hand each
time.</p>

<p>When packing the data, what's a good format to use?  Excellent
question.  Fortunately, <a name="indexId434909-187"></a><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506" target="_blank">RFC 4506</a>, the External Data
Representation Standard, already defines binary formats for a bunch of
different types, like floating point types, integer types, arrays, raw
data, etc.  I suggest conforming to that if you're going to roll the
data yourself.  But you're not obligated to.  The Packet Police are not
right outside your door.  At least, I don't <i>think</i> they are.</p>

<p>In any case, encoding the data somehow or another before you send it
is the right way of doing things!</p>









<h3 class="sect2title">7.5. <a name="sonofdataencap">Son of Data Encapsulation</a></h3>


<p>What does it really mean to encapsulate data, anyway?  In the
simplest case, it means you'll stick a header on there with either some
identifying information or a packet length, or both.</p>

<p>What should your header look like?  Well, it's just some binary
data that represents whatever you feel is necessary to complete your
project.</p>

<p>Wow.  That's vague.</p>

<p>Okay.  For instance, let's say you have a multi-user chat program
that uses <tt class="const">SOCK_STREAM</tt>s.  When a user types ("says")
something, two pieces of information need to be transmitted to the
server: what was said and who said it.</p>

<p>So far so good?  "What's the problem?" you're asking.</p>

<p>The problem is that the messages can be of varying lengths.  One
person named "tom" might say, "Hi", and another person named
"Benjamin" might say, "Hey guys what is up?"</p>

<p>So you <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> all this stuff to the clients
as it comes in.  Your outgoing data stream looks like this:</p>

<pre class="screen">t o m H i B e n j a m i n H e y g u y s w h a t i s u p ?</pre>


<p>And so on.  How does the client know when one message starts and
another stops?  You could, if you wanted, make all messages the same
length and just call the <a name="indexId434909-188"></a><b><tt class="func">sendall()</tt></b> we
implemented, <a href="advanced.html#sendall">above</a>.  But that wastes
bandwidth!  We don't want to <b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> 1024 bytes just so
"tom" can say "Hi".</p>

<p>So we <i>encapsulate</i> the data in a tiny header
and packet structure.  Both the client and server know how to pack and
unpack (sometimes referred to as "marshal" and "unmarshal") this data.
Don't look now, but we're starting to define a
<i>protocol</i> that describes how a client and server
communicate!</p>

<p>In this case, let's assume the user name is a fixed length of 8
characters, padded with <tt class="const">'\0'</tt>.  And then let's
assume the data is variable length, up to a maximum of 128
characters.  Let's have a look a sample packet structure that we might
use in this situation:</p>

<ol>


<li><tt class="tt">len</tt> (1 byte, unsigned)—The total length of the
packet, counting the 8-byte user name and chat data.</li>


<li><tt class="tt">name</tt> (8 bytes)—The user's name, NUL-padded if
necessary.</li>


<li><tt class="tt">chatdata</tt>
(<i>n</i>-bytes)—The data itself, no more than 128 bytes.
The length of the packet should be calculated as the length of this data
plus 8 (the length of the name field, above).</li>


</ol>


<p>Why did I choose the 8-byte and 128-byte limits for the fields?  I
pulled them out of the air, assuming they'd be long enough.  Maybe,
though, 8 bytes is too restrictive for your needs, and you can have a
30-byte name field, or whatever.  The choice is up to you.</p>

<p>Using the above packet definition, the first packet would consist
of the following information (in hex and ASCII):</p>

<pre class="screen">   0A     74 6F 6D 00 00 00 00 00      48 69
(length)  T  o  m    (padding)         H  i
</pre>


<p>And the second is similar:</p>

<pre class="screen">   18     42 65 6E 6A 61 6D 69 6E      48 65 79 20 67 75 79 73 20 77 ...
(length)  B  e  n  j  a  m  i  n       H  e  y     g  u  y  s     w  ...
</pre>


<p>(The length is stored in Network Byte Order, of course.  In this
case, it's only one byte so it doesn't matter, but generally speaking
you'll want all your binary integers to be stored in Network Byte Order
in your packets.)</p>

<p>When you're sending this data, you should be safe and use a
command similar to <a href="advanced.html#sendall"><b><tt class="func">sendall()</tt></b></a>, above, so you
know all the data is sent, even if it takes multiple calls to
<b><tt class="func">send()</tt></b> to get it all out.</p>

<p>Likewise, when you're receiving this data, you need to do a bit of extra
work.  To be safe, you should assume that you might receive a partial
packet (like maybe we receive "<tt class="tt">18 42 65
6E 6A</tt>" from Benjamin, above, but that's all we get in this
call to <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>).  We need to call
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> over and over again until the packet is
completely received.</p>

<p>But how?  Well, we know the number of bytes we need to receive in
total for the packet to be complete, since that number is tacked on the
front of the packet.  We also know the maximum packet size is 1+8+128,
or 137 bytes (because that's how we defined the packet.)</p>

<p>There are actually a couple things you can do here.  Since you know
every packet starts off with a length, you can call <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>
just to get the packet length.  Then once you have that, you can call it
again specifying exactly the remaining length of the packet (possibly
repeatedly to get all the data) until you have the complete packet.
The advantage of this method is that you only need a buffer large
enough for one packet, while the disadvantage is that you need to call
<b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> at least twice to get all the data.</p>

<p>Another option is just to call <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> and say the amount
you're willing to receive is the maximum number of bytes in a packet.
Then whatever you get, stick it onto the back of a buffer, and finally
check to see if the packet is complete.  Of course, you might get some
of the next packet, so you'll need to have room for that.</p>

<p>What you can do is declare an array big enough for two packets.
This is your work array where you will reconstruct packets as they
arrive.</p>

<p>Every time you <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> data, you'll append it
into the work buffer and check to see if the packet is complete.  That
is, the number of bytes in the buffer is greater than or equal to the
length specified in the header (+1, because the length in the header
doesn't include the byte for the length itself.)  If the number of bytes
in the buffer is less than 1, the packet is not complete, obviously.
You have to make a special case for this, though, since the first byte
is garbage and you can't rely on it for the correct packet
length.</p>

<p>Once the packet is complete, you can do with it what you
will.  Use it, and remove it from your work buffer.</p>

<p>Whew!  Are you juggling that in your head yet?  Well, here's the
second of the one-two punch: you might have read past the end of one
packet and onto the next in a single <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b> call.
That is, you have a work buffer with one complete packet, and an
incomplete part of the next packet!  Bloody heck.  (But this is why you
made your work buffer large enough to hold <i>two</i>
packets—in case this happened!)</p>

<p>Since you know the length of the first packet from the header, and
you've been keeping track of the number of bytes in the work buffer, you
can subtract and calculate how many of the bytes in the work buffer
belong to the second (incomplete) packet.  When you've handled the first
one, you can clear it out of the work buffer and move the partial second
packet down the to front of the buffer so it's all ready to go for the
next <b><tt class="func">recv()</tt></b>.</p>

<p>(Some of you readers will note that actually moving the partial
second packet to the beginning of the work buffer takes time, and the
program can be coded to not require this by using a circular buffer.
Unfortunately for the rest of you, a discussion on circular buffers is
beyond the scope of this article.  If you're still curious, grab a data
structures book and go from there.)</p>

<p>I never said it was easy.  Ok, I did say it was easy.  And it is;
you just need practice and pretty soon it'll come to you naturally.  By

<h3 class="sect2title">7.6. <a name="broadcast">Broadcast Packets—Hello, World!</a></h3>


<p>So far, this guide has talked about sending data from one host to one
other host.  But it is possible, I insist, that you can, with the proper
authority, send data to multiple hosts <i>at the same time</i>!</p>

<p>With <a name="indexId434909-190"></a>UDP (only UDP, not TCP) and standard IPv4, this
is done through a mechanism called <a name="indexId434909-191"></a><i>broadcasting</i>.  With IPv6, broadcasting isn't
supported, and you have to resort to the often superior technique of
<i>multicasting</i>, which, sadly I won't be discussing at this
time.   But enough of the starry-eyed future—we're stuck in the
32-bit present.</p>

<p>But wait!  You can't just run off and start broadcasting willy-nilly;
You have to <a name="indexId434909-192"></a>set the socket option <a name="indexId434909-193"></a><tt class="const">SO_BROADCAST</tt> before you can send a
broadcast packet out on the network.  It's like a one of those little
plastic covers they put over the missile launch switch!  That's just how
much power you hold in your hands!</p>

<p>But seriously, though, there is a danger to using broadcast packets,
and that is: every system that receives a broadcast packet must undo all
the onion-skin layers of data encapsulation until it finds out what port
the data is destined to.  And then it hands the data over or discards
it.  In either case, it's a lot of work for each machine that receives
the broadcast packet, and since it is all of them on the local network,
that could be a lot of machines doing a lot of unnecessary work.  When
the game Doom first came out, this was a complaint about its network
code.</p>

<p>Now, there is more than one way to skin a cat... wait a minute.  Is
there really more than one way to skin a cat?  What kind of expression
is that?  Uh, and likewise, there is more than one way to send a
broadcast packet.  So, to get to the meat and potatoes of the whole
thing: how do you specify the destination address for a broadcast
message?  There are two common ways:</p>

<ol>

<li>Send the data to a specific subnet's broadcast address.  This is the
subnet's network number with all one-bits set for the host portion of
the address.  For instance, at home my network is 192.168.1.0, my
netmask is 255.255.255.0, so the last byte of the address is my host
number (because the first three bytes, according to the netmask, are the
network number).  So my broadcast address is 192.168.1.255.  Under Unix,
the <b class="com">ifconfig</b> command will actually give you all this data.
(If you're curious, the bitwise logic to get your broadcast address is
<i><tt class="var">network_number</tt></i> OR (NOT <i><tt class="var">netmask</tt></i>).)  You can send
this type of broadcast packet to remote networks as well as your local
network, but you run the risk of the packet being dropped by the
destination's router.  (If they didn't drop it, then some random smurf
could start flooding their LAN with broadcast traffic.)</li>


<li>Send the data to the "global" broadcast address.  This is <a name="indexId434909-194"></a>255.255.255.255, aka
<a name="indexId434909-195"></a><tt class="const">INADDR_BROADCAST</tt>.  Many
machines will automatically bitwise AND this with your network number to
convert it to a network broadcast address, but some won't.  It varies.
Routers do not forward this type of broadcast packet off your local
network, ironically enough.</li>


</ol>


<p>So what happens if you try to send data on the broadcast address
without first setting the <tt class="const">SO_BROADCAST</tt> socket option?
Well, let's fire up good old <a href="clientserver.html#datagram"><b class="com">talker</b> and
<b class="com">listener</b></a> and see what happens.</p>

<pre class="screen">$ talker 192.168.1.2 foo
sent 3 bytes to 192.168.1.2
$ talker 192.168.1.255 foo
sendto: Permission denied
$ talker 255.255.255.255 foo
sendto: Permission denied
</pre>


<p>Yes, it's not happy at all...because we didn't set the
<tt class="const">SO_BROADCAST</tt> socket option.  Do that, and now you can
<b><tt class="func">sendto()</tt></b> anywhere you want!</p>

<p>In fact, that's the <i>only difference</i> between a UDP
application that can broadcast and one that can't.  So let's take the
old <b class="com">talker</b> application and add one section that sets the
<tt class="const">SO_BROADCAST</tt> socket option.  We'll call this program
<a href="http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/examples/broadcaster.c" target="_blank">
<i><tt class="var">broadcaster.c</tt></i></a>:</p>

    their_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;     // host byte order

    close(sockfd);

    return 0;
}</pre>



<p>What's different between this and a "normal" UDP client/server
situation?  Nothing!  (With the exception of the client being allowed to
send broadcast packets in this case.)  As such, go ahead and run the old
UDP <a href="clientserver.html#datagram"><b class="com">listener</b></a> program in one
window, and <b class="com">broadcaster</b> in another.  You should be now be
able to do all those sends that failed, above.</p>

<pre class="screen">$ broadcaster 192.168.1.2 foo
sent 3 bytes to 192.168.1.2
$ broadcaster 192.168.1.255 foo
sent 3 bytes to 192.168.1.255
$ broadcaster 255.255.255.255 foo
sent 3 bytes to 255.255.255.255
</pre>


<p>And you should see <b class="com">listener</b> responding that it got the
packets.  (If <b class="com">listener</b> doesn't respond, it could be because
it's bound to an IPv6 address.  Try changing the
<tt class="const">AF_UNSPEC</tt> in <i><tt class="var">listener.c</tt></i> to
<tt class="const">AF_INET</tt> to force IPv4.)</p>

<p>Well, that's kind of exciting.  But now fire up <b class="com">listener</b> on
another machine next to you on the same network so that you have two
copies going, one on each machine, and run <b class="com">broadcaster</b> again
with your broadcast address... Hey!  Both <b class="com">listener</b>s get the
packet even though you only called <b><tt class="func">sendto()</tt></b> once!
Cool!</p>

<p>If the <b class="com">listener</b> gets data you send directly to it, but not
data on the broadcast address, it could be that you have a <a name="indexId434909-196"></a>firewall on your local machine that is blocking the
packets.  (Yes, <a name="indexId434909-197"></a>Pat and <a name="indexId434909-198"></a>Bapper, thank
you for realizing before I did that this is why my sample code wasn't
working.  I told you I'd mention you in the guide, and here you are.  So
<i>nyah</i>.)</p>

<p>Again, be careful with broadcast packets.  Since every machine on the
LAN will be forced to deal with the packet whether it
<b><tt class="func">recvfrom()</tt></b>s it or not, it can present quite a load to the
entire computing network.  They are definitely to be used sparingly and
appropriately.</p>
